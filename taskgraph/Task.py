        Args:
            func (callable): target function
            args (list): argument list for ``func``
            kwargs (dict): keyword arguments for ``func``
            target_path_list (list): if not None, a list of file paths that
                are expected to be output by ``func``.  If any of these paths
                don't exist, or their timestamp is earlier than an input
                arg or work token, func will be executed.

                If ``None``, any identical calls to ``add_task`` will be
                skipped for the TaskGraph object. A future TaskGraph object
                will re-run an exact call once for its lifetime. The reasoning
                is that it is likely the user wishes to run a target-less task
                once for the lifetime of a task-graph, but would otherwise not
                have a transient result that could be re-used in a future
                instantiation of a TaskGraph object.

            task_name (string): if not None, this value is used to identify
                the task in logging messages.
            ignore_path_list (list): list of file paths that could be in
                args/kwargs that should be ignored when considering timestamp
                hashes.
            hash_target_files (bool): If True, the hash value of the target
                files will be recorded to determine if a future run of this
                function is precalculated. If False, this function only notes
                the existence of the target files before determining if
                a function call is precalculated.
            dependent_task_list (list): list of ``Task``s that this task must
                ``join`` before executing.
            ignore_directories (boolean): if the existence/timestamp of any
                directories discovered in args or kwargs is used as part
                of the work token hash.
            priority (numeric): the priority of a task is considered when
                there is more than one task whose dependencies have been
                met and are ready for scheduling. Tasks are inserted into the
                work queue in order of decreasing priority value
                (priority 10 is higher than priority 1). This value can be
                positive, negative, and/or floating point.
            hash_algorithm (string): either a hash function id that
                exists in hashlib.algorithms_available or 'sizetimestamp'.
                Any paths to actual files in the arguments will be digested
                with this algorithm. If value is 'sizetimestamp' the digest
                will only use the normed path, size, and timestamp of any
                files found in the arguments. This value is used when
                determining whether a task is precalculated or its target
                files can be copied to an equivalent task. Note if
                ``hash_algorithm`` is 'sizetimestamp' the task will require the
                same base path files to determine equality. If it is a
                ``hashlib`` algorithm only file contents will be considered.
            copy_duplicate_artifact (bool): if True and the Tasks'
                argument signature matches a previous Tasks without direct
                comparison of the target path files in the arguments other
                than their positions in the target path list, the target
                artifacts from a previously successful Task execution will
                be copied to the new one.
            hardlink_allowed (bool): if ``copy_duplicate_artifact`` is True,
                this will allow a hardlink rather than a copy when needed.
            transient_run (bool): if True, this Task will be reexecuted
                even if it was successfully executed in a previous TaskGraph
                instance. If False, this Task will be skipped if it was
                executed successfully in a previous TaskGraph instance. One
                might wish to set `transient_run` to True on a Task that does
                some sort of initialization that's needed every time a
                TaskGraph is instantiated. Perhaps to acquire dynamic resources
                or authenticate permissions.
            store_result (bool): If True, the result of ``func`` will be stored
                in the TaskGraph database and retrievable with a call to
                ``.get()`` on a ``Task`` object.

            hash_target_files (bool): If True, the hash value of the target
                files will be recorded to determine if a future run of this
                function is precalculated. If False, this function only notes

                data recorded from a previous Taskgraph run.
            priority (numeric): the priority of a task is considered when
                there is more than one task whose dependencies have been
                met and are ready for scheduling. Tasks are inserted into the

                positive, negative, and/or floating point.
            hash_algorithm (string): either a hash function id that
                exists in hashlib.algorithms_available or 'sizetimestamp'.
                Any paths to actual files in the arguments will be digested

                comparison of the target path files in the arguments other
                than their positions in the target path list, the target
                artifacts from a previously successful Task execution will
                be copied to the new one.
            hardlink_allowed (bool): if ``copy_duplicate_artifact`` is True,
                this allows taskgraph to create a hardlink rather than make a
                direct copy.
            store_result (bool): If true, the result of ``func`` will be
                stored in the TaskGraph database and retrievable with a call
                to ``.get()`` on the Task object.
